# 👋 Hi, I'm Mitko Valtchev

I'm a Computer Engineering **M.Sc. student at TU Berlin** with a strong interest in **mathematics**, **computer vision**, and **machine learning** – especially in the context of **medical imaging**.

## 💡 About Me

In a world where AI is becoming ubiquitous and raises many questions about its role in society and its interaction with individuals, I'm particularly fascinated by the ways **AI can be used to help people**.

One area that excites me most is **medicine** – because it allows AI to be used for **good**, while combining two of my favorite domains:

- 📷 Image understanding
- 🤖 Machine learning algorithms

I'm highly motivated to contribute to **AI-driven solutions** that support medical diagnosis, imaging, and treatment – and always eager to learn and grow in this field.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies I’ve Used

Here are some of the libraries and tools I've worked with:

- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch (beginner)
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, PIL
- **Jupyter Notebooks**, Git & GitHub
- Basic knowledge in Linux, Docker, Bash
