# 👋 Hi, I'm Mitko Valtchev

I'm a Computer Engineering **M.Sc. student at TU Berlin** with a strong interest in **mathematics**, **computer vision**, and **machine learning** – especially in the context of **medical imaging**.

## 💡 About Me

I specialize in AI, computer vision, and image processing, with a focus on how artificial intelligence can enhance healthcare through more accurate diagnostics, innovative solutions, and improved treatments. My background spans research, innovation management, and software development, enabling me to work across the entire lifecycle of intelligent healthcare technologies.
What excites me most is the intersection of medicine and AI — where technology can directly improve lives while bringing together two of my favorite domains:

- 📷 Image Processing
- 🤖 Machine learning algorithms 

I’m driven to develop AI-powered solutions that support medical diagnosis, imaging, and treatment — and I’m constantly learning, experimenting, and building to push these ideas forward.
